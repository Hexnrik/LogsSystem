# Logs - similar to Hastebin

I have created a similar version of Hastebin which is free to use. In case someone does not know what Hastebin is. It's a kind of editor where you can upload and share logs or other things e.g. Minecraft logs from CloudNet to share them better in Discord via link. 

All files are created locally in a folder called "logs" and can be accessed via a link.
